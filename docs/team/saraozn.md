### Project: PropertyMatch

PropertyMatch is a desktop tool is for property agents who want to organise their client profiles with their corresponding properties. Property agents can boost their efficiency by seamlessly matching their clients with their desired properties.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
